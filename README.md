[https://www.geeky-gadgets.com/bun-javascript-runtime-toolkit/] (Bun 1.0 all-in-one JavaScript runtime and toolkit)

This article discusses Bun 1.0, a new javascript runtime recently reaching version 1.0. what I find interesting is its host of features that set Bun apart from other runtime environments like node.js. One of Bun's most impressive features is its speed; it's significantly faster than node.js when running code and significantly faster in installing packages when compared to npm. Besides its speed, Bun is an all-in-one tool kit with a bundler, package manager, test runner, and built-in APIs supporting everyday JavaScript tasks like reading a file and starting an HTTP server. Furthermore, Bun is compatible with typescript and TSX files and supports common js and es5 modules. Finally, Bun is a drop-in replacement for node.js; it natively implements many node.js and web APIs. Overall, I look forward to seeing how it continues evolving and its effects on javascript and web development
